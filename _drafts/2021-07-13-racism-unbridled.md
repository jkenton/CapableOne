As ever lately, when something hits me a certain way, I wander down to the Aging Matador to try to figure it out in myself.

Today, it's the outpouring of outrage toward three footballers from England, who all missed their penalty kicks at the recent Euro 2020 Championships. All three were black. [Background](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/12/1015239599/prince-william-and-boris-johnson-denounce-the-racist-abuse-of-englands-soccer-te)

Lest anyone think this is isolated, it is not. Football (or soccer if you must) is *deadly* serious stuff. Players who've missed penalty shots, or scored on their own goal have been harrassed in the past (or even killed) [Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Escobar). There are those who take the game too seriously. In such cases, their pride gets involved somehow, and any slight by *the fucking team of guys they've never met* somehow becomes an indication of the way the world will look at them *personally* for all time? It's craziness.

But this issue with the Black footballers in England touches a more familiar chord. At least to me. See, the US has had its own round of racism run amok lately. Here's an example in time. August 11 and 12, 2017, the [Unite the Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) rally takes place in Charlottesville VA. The goal here was to protest the planned removal of a statue to Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It turned violent, and at least one person was killed. I'll leave the reader here to learn more about the nature of the protests (Spoiler: the statue wasn't really the purpose). Fast-forward almost four years, and the statue was removed without incident [Statues Removed](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/10/us/charlottesville-statues-coming-down/index.html).

In an oversimplified nutshell, there was a *rash* of "Southern" statuary erected (any Freudian connotation unintended) in the 1920s and 1930s, maybe as a response to a bunch of nationalist statuary that began appearing in the early 1900s. The monuments on the Mall in Washington DC are an example of the nationalist statuary. I'm guessing that the southerners who supported the *other* statues were feeling like their heroes were being left out. So, up they went in town parks throughout the South.

In any event, the era that these statues venerated was one of intense division in this country. A contentious division over the topic of slavery. The Southern economy until 1863's Emancipation Proclamation was built on the backs of free (slave) labor. And the Civil War was fought to bring the secessionist states back into the fold. And President Lincoln was assassinated by a Southern partisan in 1865, just a couple of weeks after the war was ended by surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.

I have the sense that Reconstruction under Lincoln would have gone differently, perhaps even more humanely, than it did under Presidents Johnson and Grant. And maybe the Southerners would have been welcomed back without so much derision and without being downtrodden.

In any event, there are folks out there who have misplaced hatred toward black people (and brown people), and they want to fly their White Supremacist flag high for all to see. I guess as an ethos goes, there's nothing wrong with being proud of oneself. But, that's not really what's going on. The population of the United States used to be majority white. And now, the percentage of citizens in the country who are white is in decline. In a few years, if trends continue, Whites will become a minority. The reasons why are numerous, yet, not the Black and Brown people's fault.

When US President number 45 took office, he promised that "a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it's going to be only America first." That was in January of 2017. The rest of his inauguration empowered his base to believe that they had been wronged for decades, and that was going to end. No more would an American need to feel like their share of the American dream would be diminshed or prevented by *others* outside the borders, or in bungled trade agreements. Maybe August 2017 was the violent beginning, and the Insurrection at the Capitol in January 2021 was the culmination? Who knows? We're still in it.

In short, racism is *EVERYWHERE*. Not just in other countries, also here in the US. Racism only takes the slightest provocation to emerge *worm-like* from the festering holes where it lies in remission. Until a trigger calls it forth. You know, like when a black or brown person representing the country makes a mistake. Or when a statue to a traitor, or celebrating a traitorous cause, is put in danger of removal. And then you've got the White Supremacist bullshit running amok on city streets, people proudly and openly flying the Battle Flag of the Southern army. Why?

Maybe it's fear? Fear that "all the hard work and effort will be ruined" by allowing another group to sit at the table.
