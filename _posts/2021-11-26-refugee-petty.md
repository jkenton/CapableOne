[Ed: Because there are rules.]

We got somethin' we both know it  
We don't talk too much about it  
Ain't no real big secret all the same  
Somehow we get around it  
Listen it don't really matter to me baby  
You believe what you want to believe  
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)

Somewhere, somehow somebody  
Must have kicked you around some  
Tell me why you want to lay there  
Revel in your abandon  
Honey, it don't make no difference to me baby  
Everybody's had to fight to be free  
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)  
Now baby you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee) No

Baby we ain't the first  
I'm sure a lot of other lover's been burned  
Right now this seems real to you  
But it's one of those things  
You gotta feel to be true

Somewhere, somehow somebody  
Must have kicked you around some  
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped  
Tied up, taken away and held for ransom, honey  
It don't really matter to me baby  
Everybody's had to fight to be free  
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)  
No you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)  
You don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)  
Oh, oh, oh
