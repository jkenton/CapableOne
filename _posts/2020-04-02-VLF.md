I'm a late-comer to the London Fog scene. Before now it was always only breakfast teas. A friend introduced me to London Fog about a year ago. Ever since, London Fogs have been a very nice change of pace. I must say that the Harney & Sons Victorian London Fog tea is exceptional. I drink tea without any sugar or milk, and the VLF tasted outstanding hot and unadulterated. I also have a habit of making a pot of tea, forgetting about it for several hours, tasting the resulting beverage, and inevitably pouring it out. Breakfast teas are like that, I guess. The VLF tasted wonderful cold. The vanilla and lavender really took a front seat. Harney & Sons VLF is a true double treat! Highly recommended!
