**Digging up Francisco Franco**

"The nationalist ruler was interred in the mausoleum -- which was partially built by political prisoners of his regime and is the site of a mass grave of Spanish Civil War victims -- soon after his death in 1975.
It has since become a draw for tourists and far-right sympathizers who rally at it on the anniversary of Franco's death on November 20." (CNN, 2019; below)

**Das Ohrlaeppchen des Diktators (The Dictator's Earlobe)**

*Wait for me in Heaven* (English Translation)

"Pepe Soriano plays a Madrid shopkeeper who is kidnapped by henchmen of Franco in this political comedy. After his kidnapping, he is forced to become the dictator's double for many official ceremonies. Due to his long and unexplained absence, Pepe's wife believes her husband has been abducted and killed, so she tries to reach her husband through spiritualism. After Pepe surprises her with a nocturnal visit, he tells her he will touch his ear to signal it is he and not Franco in public appearances."
