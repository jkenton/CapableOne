When I was a younger man, I worked in tech support for a academic department within the College of Agriculture.

Around about that time, a guru named Tom told me about a tool of wizardy called BBEdit.

I used the hell out of BBEdit. I was awesome. It made all manner of drudgery around text manipulation simply disappear. A miracle!

And now, after many years of trying other text tools, I'm back. My last licensed version was 9.x or somesuch, though I upgraded it at one time to 11.x (though only for sentimental reasons...)

Alright, enough yacking. Time to return to the grindstone!
