**Caged Bird**
BY MAYA ANGELOU

A free bird leaps<br />
on the back of the wind   <br />
and floats downstream   <br />
till the current ends<br />
and dips his wing<br />
in the orange sun rays<br />
and dares to claim the sky.<br />
<br />
But a bird that stalks<br />
down his narrow cage<br />
can seldom see through<br />
his bars of rage<br />
his wings are clipped and   <br />
his feet are tied<br />
so he opens his throat to sing.<br />
<br />
The caged bird sings   <br />
with a fearful trill   <br />
of things unknown   <br />
but longed for still   <br />
and his tune is heard   <br />
on the distant hill   <br />
for the caged bird   <br />
sings of freedom.<br />
<br />
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br />
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br />
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br />
and he names the sky his own.<br />

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   <br />
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br />
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   <br />
so he opens his throat to sing.<br />

The caged bird sings   <br />
with a fearful trill   <br />
of things unknown   <br />
but longed for still   <br />
and his tune is heard   <br />
on the distant hill   <br />
for the caged bird   <br />
sings of freedom.<br />
