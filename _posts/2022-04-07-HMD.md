Today is Thursday April 7, 2022

In my cup is Coke Zero Sugar. Tasty.

It's raining real hard today, so the song of the day is *When the Levee Breaks* by the mostly unknown British band called Led Zeppelin...

Today's long form something is on the topic of Asking the right question, of the right person, at the right time.

Enjoy!
