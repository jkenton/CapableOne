Making a lot of progress at work, re: fully online course I am developing. It's kinda weird developing it again, given that I've taught it a few times online already.

HOWEVER! This is an opportunity to make it better. I will not pass up that opportunity! 

At the same time, I am investigating how to relax when I am not working. That project is moving apace.

In the meantime, **PEACE**!
