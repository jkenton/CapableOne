1. Today is Wednesday, April 27, 2022
2. Today, I have a lot of grading to do, and an event to prepare for. The event is a Twitter Chat with my students from one of the classes I teach.
3. Today, my cup has instant Vietnamese Milk Coffee (a "sometimes" drink due to the volume of sugar...) Cafe Pho brand. Ask for it by name. Delicious.
