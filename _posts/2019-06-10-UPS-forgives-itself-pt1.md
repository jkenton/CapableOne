I have been waiting a week or so for a package to arrive from New York. Ordinarily, packages from New York arrive within a couple of days. So, today I looked online to see if there was a reason.



Along the top of the screen was this advisory:


>Summary (Last Updated: 06/09/2019; 13:16) Atmospheric Conditions Affecting Global Aviation May Cause Delays

>Atmospheric Conditions Affecting Global Aviation May Cause Delays

>Due to atmospheric conditions that have affected aviation globally, some shipments may experience unavoidable delays.
Contingency plans are in place and UPS is working to move shipments to their final destinations as quickly as conditions
permit. Track your package (https://www.ups.com/WebTracking/track?loc=en_US) for the status of your shipment and
continue to check here for the latest information on service delays.
<br />
**Note that the UPS Service Guarantee (https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/legal-terms-conditions/service.page) does
not apply to shipments affected by this service disruption. For more information, refer to the UPS Tariff/Terms and
Conditions of Service.**

(emphasis mine)
Convenient! Translation: We've declared an emergency. You cannot protest this decision, and we do not have to prove that conditions exist. If you paid extra to have your package delivered overnight, or "faster than normal", and it did not arrive on time, you are out of luck. Thanks for your business!

Alas, this was just the start of my woes...
