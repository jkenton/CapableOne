Sometimes, there is a *perfect* word the situation; A single word that captures the full essence of intended meaning. In those instances, I will rejoice at the existence of the word, and begin using it immediately to help explain complicated issues as simply as possible.

Today, I recognized the *need* for a word that I feel may not exist. Furthermore, I believe that the technological focus I perceive virtually *demands* there be a word that serves this purpose.

So, here is the situation:

Let's say you are trying to unravel a problem; a problem so complex that there is no available or well-understood pathway to solution (maybe even like the [Gordian Knot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot)). There IS a solution - People HAVE solved it - but there is no simple documented procedure.

Then, along comes a process/procedure/pathway that seems to provide a good solution. That strategy, however, is very involved/complex/complicated/difficult to understand.

(Now here is where there should be a word)

*"The looming sense that the time devoted to understanding the existing solution strategy will seem wasteful because a better/more elegant solution is just over the horizon."*

Not precisely frustration. Not precisely the explanation for some types of procrastination. Not precisely feeling insufficient to the task. Not precisely an emptiness for failing to understand. But a looming sense that the time devoted to understanding the existing solution strategy will seem wasteful because a better/more elegant solution is just over the horizon.

If I have to, I will create a word. And because many of the words we use to describe these oddly specific fears come from German, let me propose: *Loesungseleganzverbesserungsangst*.

And because I studied German in Switzerland for a *whole year* - and I feel like I understand the German tendency to append and prepend stems and roots to achieve a particular purpose - Â this word means roughly, "the fear of impending improvements to the elegance of a solution strategy".

Does anyone else out there have a better (or more elegant) solution?
