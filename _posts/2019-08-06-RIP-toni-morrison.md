I read some Toni Morrison books in college and grad school. As a white guy, I didn't have much by which to relate to her stories. Yet, they were uniformly fantastic and very informative. I am a better person for having read them.

She won the Nobel prize in 1993. 

The picture above shows her with President Obama in May of 2012. What a giant!

Rest well.
