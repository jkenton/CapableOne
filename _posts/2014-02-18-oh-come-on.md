I call shenanigans on this whole thing... Spend all day in the office, working hard, then discover that a very important tire on your car is FLAT. A SCREW is sticking out of it. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ALL ABOUT?

Then, I called the campus police to see if they could give me some love changing the tire. No love.

Anyhow, I changed the tire, and got on my way. A nice lesson in slowing down, I guess.
