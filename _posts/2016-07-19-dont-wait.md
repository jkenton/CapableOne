[Ed: Here's a song about the virtue of not hesitating... *Sometimes you got to lose it all / Before you find your way* ]

You can cry a million tears<br />
You can wait a million years<br />
If you think that time will change your ways<br />
Don't wait too long<br />
<br />
When your morning turns to night<br />
Who'll be loving you by candlelight<br />
If you think that time will change your ways<br />
Don't wait too long<br />
<br />

Maybe I got a lot to learn<br />
Time can slip away<br />
Sometimes you got to lose it all<br />
Before you find your way<br />
<br />

Take a chance, play your part<br />
Make romance, it might break your heart<br />
But if you think that time will change your ways<br />
Don't wait too long<br />
<br />
It may rain, it may shine<br />
Love will age like fine red wine<br />
But if you think that time will change your ways<br />
Don't wait too long<br />
<br />

Maybe you and I got a lot to learn<br />
Don't waste another day<br />
Maybe you got to lose it all<br />
Before you find your way<br />
Take a chance, play your part<br />
Make romance, it might break your heart<br />
But if you think that time will change your ways<br />
Don't wait too long<br />
Don't wait<br />
Hmm... Don't wait<br />
