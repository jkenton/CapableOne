I purchased the iA Writer app for my smartphone and Pixelbook. It's not 100% perfect for my use case, because I am in the rare group of folks for whom the app cannot interact correctly with Google Drive. Yet another way that I am a 2%-er.

But, I am in conversation with the folks at [Information Architects](http://ia.net) to potentially help figure it out. I just thought of another thing to share with them about my use case. Be right back...

OK, I am back. I will be patient and try to help work this out with them. The software is excellent and powerful. And right now, if you use Dropbox exclusively, it works amazingly!

More when I know more!

Cheers!
