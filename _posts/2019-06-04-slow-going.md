I have known a lot of people in my life so far who rejoiced at the notion that they might not ever need to learn anything more (after a certain point).

I haven't found that potential point for myself, yet.

Anyhow, I think it was Leonardo da Vinci who said *Ancora Imparo* (I still have much to learn).

And some wizened brewer for years past said "the more I learn about beer, the more I realize I need to know about beer." (or something like that)

So, it's *SLOW GOING*, but progress!
