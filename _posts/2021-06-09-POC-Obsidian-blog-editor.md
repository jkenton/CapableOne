OK, I edited this entry in Obsidian, and dumped the resulting file and its image file into the folder that  holds the github pages stuff, and then synced it.

DId it work?

What broke, if anything?

Is it ready for prime time, mostly?

Results: I can't easily do the git push  command without it forcing me to use a deprecated login method. But, I can fire up Atom or whatever to do the pushes. Resisting the urge to learn how to make the command line stuff work... Resist... Resist...
