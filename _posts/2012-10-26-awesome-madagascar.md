I am sitting in the cafeteria of my kid's school and watching the movie Madagascar 3. During the circus scene there is a Katy Perry song.

Wanna know what is awesome? Hearing almost every kid sing the chorus.

Awesome.

Want to see the MOST awesome thing EVER? Just before the credits rolled, the Katy Perry song reprises, and EVERY kid got up and started dancing. It was like watching a flock of seagulls. EVERY kid at once.

Tears filled my eyes.
