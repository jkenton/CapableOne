Today's mood...

*Fifty ugly soldiers holding spears by the iron door <br />
knives and spikes  and guns and the likes <br />
of every tool of pain <br />
A sinister midget with a bucket and a mop <br />
where the blood goes down the drain*

Not to worry. At least there is *coffee* and *fear of failure*...

*Who are all those people <br />
he's locked away down there <br />
Are they crazy? Are they sainted? <br />
Are they zeroes someone painted? <br />
its never been explained  <br />
since at first it was created <br />
but a dungeon like a sin <br />
requires not but locking in <br />
of everything thats ever been <br />
Look at her, look at him*
