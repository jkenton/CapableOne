My Strange Nation has ocean on two sides
and the Bama Crimson Tide
in the South
Tilted slightly toward the North,
the immigrants pour forth
seeking Phoenix and life hand to mouth.

My Strange Nation tilts sharply to the right
with our leaders straight and white
as our teeth
Our populations mixed
But our elections fixed
 in my strange Nation, America

My Strange Nation built on the backs of slaves
who were sailed here cross the waves from far away.
This cruel experiment was ended by a President
Who was both a Republican and gay

My Strange Nation gave the Indians our germs
they surrendered on our terms
as in died.
They're survivors fight appeals.
So we gave them roulette wheels
In my strange Nation, America

But my strange nation has lost its mind again
sending young women and men
off to war
for reasons that aren't clear
unless you're standing near
To the rich, and the righteous, and the bored

And my strange nation
enamored of the Cross
and who will win the toss
of the coin
the circus and the bread
distract us from the dead
In my strange nation, America

But my strange nation will surely come around
For you cannot hold us down
For long
We’ll sputter and we’ll cough
And throw the despots off
And recover the soul that makes us strong.

And my frustration is just a product of
My strange but loyal love
For this land
For its mountains and it's lakes
tornadoes and earthquakes
for its poets and Pioneers
for its fetishes and fears.
For its freedom of dissent
For its greasy government

And I will not change this stance
I will not move to France
I will always hold out one more chance
For my strange nation, America.
