 The other day, I heard some folks discussing their plans for getting together with friends in a non-romantic way on February 14. Folks with romantic partners would, I guess, be celebrating Valentine's Day. The people I heard were talking about ways to describe the event in a way that evoked the thought of Valentine's Day, without using those words. I heard Galentine's Day and Palentine's Day, among others.

 My brain couldn't sit still. (Steven) Seagalentine's Day virtually burst forth like Athena from the skull of Zeus:

 - An opportunity to gather with friends and watch Steven Seagal movies
 - With lots of Asian takout food
 - Spanning the continuum of Seagal movies from the early blockbusters to the direct to streaming films of recent years
 - Perhaps the sequence of the day could not be strictly chronological, but all "phases" of his long career need to be featured
 - Or maybe just the ones that were very successful (When I asked Gemini, it wanted to equivocate on the defintion of the word "successful: focusing on a mix of box office earnings and critical reception"), such as *Under Siege*, *Above the Law*, *Under Siege 2*, and *Hard to Kill*

There are A LOT OF MOVIES from which to choose. Quoting from wikipedia: "In 1988, Seagal made his acting debut in *Above the Law*. By 1991, he had starred in four films." By my count, there are nearly 60 films and two TV series (*Steven Seagal: Lawman* and *True Justice*) that feature him. 

A person could, if they chose to, feature just the award-nominated movies from the Pantheon of Seagal:
- *On Deadly Ground*
- *Executive Decision*
- *Fire Down Below*
- *Half Past Dead*


Or the ones where Seagal played at least three of the four role types (Director, Producer, Writer, Actor)
- *Above the Law*
- *On Deadly Ground*
- *Shadow Man*
- *Attack Force*
- *Kill Switch*
- *The Keeper*
- *Born to Raise Hell*
- *Attrition*

So, there you have it. Enjoy. In moderation.
