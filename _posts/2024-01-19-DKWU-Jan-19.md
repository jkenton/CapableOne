Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of coffee, and shares some tidbits about the day ahead. Yesterday had some technical issues. Yet, life went on, didn't it? Useful information, that.

Staying at home to avoid getting into an accident is not fear or anxiety. It is maturity.

It is important to find the coffee creamer than complements the taste of your favorite coffee. Home-grown delicious is the best kind of delicious. And finding those combinations are especially fun for nerds. (Spoiler: I am a nerd.)

Enjoy!
