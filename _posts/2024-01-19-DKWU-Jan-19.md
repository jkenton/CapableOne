Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of coffee, and shares some tidbits about the day ahead. Yesterday had some technical issues. Yet, life went on, didn't it? Useful information, that.

Staying at home to avoid getting into an accident is not fear or anxiety. It is maturity.

It is important to find the coffee creamer than complements the taste of your favorite coffee. Home-grown delicious is the best kind of delicious. And finding those combinations are especially fun for nerds. (Spoiler: I am a nerd.)

[Ed: I keep attributing the quote "Keep and Continue" to Sammy Sosa. I am almost certain to my bones that he said it during a very successful streak he was on. Maybe during his homerun chase of Mark McGwire back in the day. But, I cannot FIND an interview or video where he actually says it... So, maybe it's just an hallucination? If this channel ever gets any engagement, maybe someone can find a clip and share it with me. Until then, I will maintain that Sammy said it, it SEEMS inscrutable, but it is very clear once you think about it for a few seconds.]


Enjoy!
