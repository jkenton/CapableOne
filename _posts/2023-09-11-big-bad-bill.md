[Ed: Can you imagine, knowing that Van Halen would include synthesizers in the place of a guitar solo on one of their major hits (at Eddie's insistence), that Eddie didn't want that song on a Van Halen record? And that David Lee Roth insisted that it be included?  And that it is the only known recording of his dad playing (he's the one playing clarinet)? Well, as a guy with some age on him, I can imagine. And I am grateful to know it, and to understand that Eddie changed his mind about the song, perhaps when his dad wasn't around. Hopefully before then, but I don't know into the man's mind.]
