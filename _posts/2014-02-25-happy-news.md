I have been pretty clear to all who will listen to me. There is a lot of detriment to reading the negative news stories so prevalent in the world. People hurting other people. Fires, guns, explosions, death, destruction. It can start to weigh on a person's soul to only hear about the shitty shit that happens out there. Especially when people get to hear about this crap when they first wake up, or right before they are going to bed. Unhealthy.


To any newsperson out there: Why in the heck do these stories get written in the first place?

Psychologists: Why do we have such a fascination to learn about the un-ease afforded other people?

So, my prototypical antidote story for these kinds of events is this:

**One kid gives another kid a balloon. Both kids smile.**

Why the photo above? Well, it looks like this desire for happiness crosses the divide between species. See, both dogs started out a little grumpy. Then one dog kissed the other dog. And finally, they are both happy.

**One dog kisses another dog. Both dogs smile.**

Can't we have that?
