One of my favorite podcasts is <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>.

A recent thread (in episodes since about 325; current episode is 338) discusses the concept of *Aloha* as a life management principle. That is, to shape ones response to the "aloha" inherent in the situation. Being calm and making deliberate choices is "aloha". Running around with  reckless abandon, wanting things done NOW, NOW, NOW! is "not aloha". A turtle is ALWAYS aloha. A "harsh toke" is the *opposite* of aloha. I hope the definition is clear now.

There must be something about living closer to the equator. I mean, I live in the 40s north latitude. Hawaii is in the low 20s north. People here are *in*-tense. People *there* are less likely to be as intense. For example, people in Denmark are *fribble frabble* and people from Italy are more *jibba wibba*.

Maybe, this is a project...
