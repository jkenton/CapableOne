```
Well, I had just got out from the county prison
Doin' ninety days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position
But no matter how smooth I talked
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was genius
The man say, "we got all that we can use"
Now I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
Working at the car wash blues


Well, I should be sittin' in an air conditioned office
In a swivel chair
Talkin' some trash to the secretaries
Sayin', "here, now mama, come on over here"
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
Workin' at the car wash blues

Bridge
You know a man of my ability
He should be smokin' on a big cigar
But 'til I get myself straight I guess I'll just have to wait
In my rubber suit rubbin' these cars
Well, all I can do is to shake my head
You might not believe that it's true
For workin' at this end of Niagara Falls
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes

So baby, don't expect to see me
With no double martini in any high brow society news
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
Workin' at the car wash blues
So baby, don't expect to see me
With no double martini in any high brow society news
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
Workin' at the car wash blues
Yeah, I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
Workin' at the car wash blues
```

And now live!
