For some reason, I liked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Shandling">Garry Shandling</a>. A lot. The guy had an amazing head of hair, and never seemed comfortable in his skin. He was always making and taking jokes at his own expense. At least that was the case for the characters he played as a comedian.

But listen to the <a href="http://youmadeitweird.nerdistind.libsynpro.com/garry-shandling-re-release-0">Garry Shandling episode</a> of "You Made it Weird" with Pete Holmes. Delightful. Personable. Authentic. Awesome.
And for your viewing pleasure:
