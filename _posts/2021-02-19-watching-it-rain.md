I spent a lot of time in the past<br/>
Kissing other people's ass<br/>
Now I'm where I want to be<br />
Sitting here watching it rain<br />

Took off my shoes and dumped out the rocks<br />
Got my snakes back into a box<br />
Now I'm where I want to be<br />
Sitting here watching it rain<br />

Chorus<br />
Well it's a crime to spend your time<br />
trying to comply<br />
When the best you're gong to get if you're lucky<br />
is to just get by.<br />

Finally made some money and that's good<br />
The price I had to pay was rude<br />
Now I'm where I want to be<br />
Sitting here watching it rain<br />
