Prince died on Friday the 22nd, leaving a pretty big void in the music industry. He had a massive and prolific career. I can't really claim to have been a big fan, though there are some songs of his that are very memorable to me.

He had a singular purpose, and fought his distributor so hard that he eventually changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. I assume he did it to maintain control over his image, likeness, and creativity. But, like I said, I wasnt a big fan.

He also had a wicked sense of humor. After being featured in a skit on Dave Chapelle's show, Prince released a single with the <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/16/prince_chappelle.jpg.CROP.article568-large.jpg" target="\_blank">single best response to that skit</a>.

So in that vein, I saw the video above and thought it summed things up quite nicely

_It was seven forty-five we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me_

_All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose_

_Her favorite number was twenty and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say_

_Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam_

_Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found?_

_Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, honey
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam, oh oh
Ooh, hoo Starfish and coffee_

_Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singin'_

_Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam,_

_oh ho, oh (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh hoo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la), oh
Oh hoo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh hoo (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)_
