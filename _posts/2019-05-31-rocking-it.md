Today is the due date for the project I am working on at work. Yesterday went really good, and the final details are what remain.

I may have just jinxed myself...

In any event, I'd like to get this one off my desk before I leave today; for a number of reasons. Maybe mostly, *pride*?

Anyhow, Keep a good thought for me today.
