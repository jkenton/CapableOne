Lyrics

I don't drink coffee, I take tea, my dear  
I like my toast done on one side  
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk  
I'm an Englishman in New York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue  
A walking cane here at my side  
I take it everywhere I walk  
I'm an Englishman in New York

Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York  
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York

If "manners maketh man" as someone said  
He's the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  
Be yourself no matter what they say

Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York  
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien  
I'm an Englishman in New York

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety  
You could end up as the only one  
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society  
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

Takes more than combat gear to make a man  
Takes more than a license for a gun  
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can  
A gentleman will walk but never run

If "manners maketh man" as someone said  
He's the hero of the day  
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say  
Be yourself no matter what they say

Be yourself no matter what they say (oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien)  
Be yourself no matter what they say (I'm an Englishman in New York)

Sting is a good musician, and seems a good sort.
