Go ahead and click that link. I'll be here when you are done.

"To use your name and likeness in perpetuity throughout the Universe."

and

"What do we need you for?"

and

"Perfectly legal because I signed the contract."

and

"This industry is a Monster."

and

"You want something done right, I guess you gotta do it yourself."

and

"If you ever liked me. If you ever thought there was anything worthwhile about me. I'm begging you, please don't watch that show."

and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22188470/dave-chappelles-show-hbo-max-netflix-why">it seems to be working</a>.  

Dave is an inspiration, and a social mirror (someone who holds a mirror up to you in a way that shows what you really look like). We are lucky to have him.

And don't watch Chapelle's Show, until they pay him.
