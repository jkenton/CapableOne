Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of reheated Decent (tm) tea, and shares some tidbits about the day ahead. A

Recommendations:

- Drink more water (64-80 oz, dosed throughout day)

- Eat more protein (100 gr minimum)

- Eat more vegetables (colorful plates!)

- Get my HR up for 10-15 mins (not aiming for high intensity, just get the heart rate up into a Heart Rate zone for 1-15 mins each day)
