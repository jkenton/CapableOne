I find myself often heading down a path I'd like to call "Unnecessary Nerdery". This path leads to crushing bouts of frustration, anger, anxietyâ€¦ But also stunning peaks of amazement and accomplishment. Is this a gambler's dilemma? Like, the little infrequent dopamine squirt that is supposed to offset the hours and days of mental anguish?

Maybe.

At the end, things are incrementally better somehow. I learned some tidbits. No permanent damage?
