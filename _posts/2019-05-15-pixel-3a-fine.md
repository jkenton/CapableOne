I’m not a professional reviewer. I like the Pixel 3a. It is light. It is fast. It has a 3.5mm audio jack. It has no notch.

It has a bright 5.5″ screen, and it does all I want it to.

I’m not a snob for the XL (though I owned a Pixel XL, and a Pixel 2XL). The extra size turns out to be just a touch too big. That is an ironic statement, given the monster size of the Nexus 6 I bought when I initially signed up for Google (nee Project) Fi in August of 2015.

If you can scrape together $399 (though some places have good promotions that will lower the cost), there is no clear reason not to buy this phone.

Thanks for your attention!
