As a younger man, I loved butter toffee (Ok, you got me. I still love butter toffee...). I used to go out of my way to eat Skor bars. I found them delicious.  Nowadays, when someone talks about toffee in an ice cream confection, or the like, it is Heath as the gold standard.

It surprised me recently when I realized that I had never tried two of the heavyweights of chocolate covered toffee side by side. Of course, I mean [Heath bar](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_bar) and [Skor](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skor).

I was wandering through one of my two local 7-11s  (literally less than a quarter mile from each other), and saw the two boxes of bars sitting within my visual field. I bought one of each, and a bottle of water against the heat and humidity outside, and off I went.

I tried the Heath bar first. The chocolate was good, the toffee was crunchy and buttery. Almost like a prototypical toffee experience. This is what chocolate covered toffee was meant to taste like, and that explains why the market saturation in all things that include toffee.

Then I drank some water. Lord, there is a lot of sugar in toffee.

Next, came the Skor bar.

The chocolate was lifeless. The toffee had a faint scorched taste. The toffee was almost thin tasting. I learned something today. I will never go out of my way to eat a Skor bar. I will also never eat a Skor bar when a Heath bar is also available.

Now, it surprises me a little to discover - through my sole source of external information, Wikipedia - that Skor and Heath are both owned by Hershey. I am pretty sure that Hershey acquired Heath for its excellent reputation. So, why continue selling Skor (a pale and lifeless imitation)?

It is clear to me that I will not comprehend any offered solution. I will remember which chocolate covered toffee bar I like better.

And that will be that.
