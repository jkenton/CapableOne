Today was pretty great. Jeremiah Lloyd Harmon (who made the top six in American Idol this year, and is the Director of Music Ministries at my church) was back this Sunday. He says he'll be back for the month of June. Then who knows? I gotta admit, the kid sings like an angel. He is definitely moved from within to be a decent, motivated person. I'm lucky to know him.

Lots of spontaneous requests for help and prayers today. Prayers for successful eye surgery, for an ailing centenarian, for health, welfare, children, friends, and family.

Which reminds me: I'm pretty blessed. I forget that sometimes.
