[Ed: Yes, rules are rules. But, this song gets the blood flowin' in a way that I must say is not indecent. #EatTheRich]

Some folks are born made to wave the flag  
They're red, white and blue  
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"  
They point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no senator's son, son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand  
Lord, don't they help themselves, yeah  
But when the taxman comes to the door  
The house look a like a rummage sale

It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one

Yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes  
They send you down to war  
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"  
They only answer, "More, more, more"

It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no military son, son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one
