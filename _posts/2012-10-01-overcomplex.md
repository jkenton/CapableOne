I learned some important things morning.
<ul><li>I can transfer recordings from many sources to a computer that has Dragon NaturallySpeaking installed, and I can transcribe those files using the remote microphone profile. Dragon requires a microphone profile to be active when transcribing.
<li>I have a VPN set up to allow me to connect to my home computer from my office, or using one of my devices. Because I can put my recordings in DropBox (and from ANYWHERE in the world), they will eventually show up in the DropBox on my home computer.
<li>When I want to transcribe some files, I connect to my home computer over the Internet, drag files from the DropBox folder to the Dragon Bar and transcribe them while connected to my home computer with VNC.
<li>Now I can send files to be transcribed while I'm at the office and not worry about them not getting transcribed until I get home and plug in the microphone.
