title: "Always trying new things"
---
Oh hey there! I'm writing this using a *markdown editor* directly. How about **that**?

Anyhow, this is an example of a guy trying new things. Not getting too comfortable in any particular frame of mind. Also, I probably could do more, you know, worky-work? SILENCE! This *is for my work*!

Sometimes, these *helpful* markdown editors really screw things up with their helpful offer to pair things like braces, or brackets, or quote marks, or apostrophes, etc. And unless you are a Wild Man, with steely eyes and impeccable virtue, the sometimes doubled quote mark doesn't behave. Is that the app, or the user? Who knows? I guess it is helpful more than 50% of the time, so not something to complain about.

I GUESS!
