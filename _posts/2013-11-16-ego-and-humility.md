I am reading an article that deals with the concept of Ego and how it can get in the way of creative work. I have to say that it resonates very strongly with me. Almost scary how much it resonates.

There were three phrases in the article that really smacked me around:

"You are putting your own need for recognition ahead of the work and ahead of the mission of your team."

"Be aware when you are generally contributing and when you are simply trying to protect the status quo."

"Collaboration also becomes more challenging, because others grow tired of walking on eggshells. You must nix the tendency to be easily offended and instead embrace the opportunity that disagreements or disconfirming information provide to sharpen your thoughts and skills."
