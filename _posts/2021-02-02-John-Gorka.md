*I'm from New Jersey / My mom's Italian / I've read those Mafia books / We don't belong*

I saw John Gorka perform at a place called <a href="https://iowa-city.vinetavern.com/">The Vine</a> in Iowa City IA. I went with the guy who lived across the hall from me, and the person who was to become my ex-wife (but not right away). 

And now a live version:

BONUS:

*By they way, how is my heart ? / I haven't seen it since you left / I'm almost sure it followed you / Could you sometime send it back? / I'll buy the ticket*

The guy I went with was REALLY a big fan of Mr. Gorka. Wanted him to "come back to his dorm room to have a free place to stay." Thankfully, Mr. Gorka demurred. I don't think that guy just wanted him to have a place to spend the night for free... And Mr. Gorka is still alive! Check him out if you get the chance!
