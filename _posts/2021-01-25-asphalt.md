I don't know what this look I have is, but it seems like every time I've left the house past couple of weeks a guy drives up in a pickup truck, rolls down his window, and asks me if I want my parking pad re-asphalted.

I always say the same thing: "Not in the Market". And usually they drive away. But today the guy got out of his pickup truck and handed me a premade flyer with his information and he said "When you *are* in the market, keep me in mind."

He claims that he and I have spoken before about it. I don't remember it. It might just be a tactic. Anyway, I thought it was kind of strange. After telling me this about our prior conversation (*which I don't remember, and am fully convinced did not happen*), he turned and walked back to his truck, showing a significant amount of butt crack.

What is it about January that makes people think I really should get my parking pad resurfaced? Why the flyer? Most importantly, why the butt crack? C'mon man, do better.

Anyway, have a good day.
