[Those *harmonics*... So good.]

*She'll tell you she's an orphan, After you meet her family*

Lyrics
She never mentions the word addiction <br />
In certain company<br />
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan<br />
After you meet her family<br /><br />

She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket<br />
She wears a cross around her neck<br />
Yes the hair is from a little boy<br />
And the cross from someone she has not met<br /><br />

Not yet<br /><br />

Chorus:<br />

Says she talks to angels<br />
Says they all know her name<br />
Oh yeah, she talks to angels<br />
Says they call her out by her name<br /><br />

She don't know no lover<br />
None that I ever seen<br />
And to her that ain't nothing<br />
But to me it means, means everything<br /><br />

She paints her eyes as black as night now<br />
She pulls those shades down tight<br />
Oh yeah there's a smile when the pain comes<br />
The pain gonna make everything alright<br />

Chorus<br /><br />

She talks to angels<br />
Says they call her out by her name<br />
Oh yeah, yeah angels<br />
Call her out by her name<br />
Oh, oh, oh angels<br />
They call her out by her name<br /><br />

Oh, she talks to angels<br />
They call her out,<br />
Yeah, yeah call her out<br />
Don't you know that they call her out<br />
By her name<br />
