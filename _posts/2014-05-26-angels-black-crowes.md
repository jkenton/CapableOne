[Those *harmonics*... So good.]

*She'll tell you she's an orphan, After you meet her family*

She never mentions the word addiction
In certain company
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
After you meet her family

She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
She wears a cross around her neck
Yes the hair is from a little boy
And the cross from someone she has not met

Not yet

Chorus:

Says she talks to angels
Says they all know her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

She don't know no lover
None that I ever seen
And to her that ain't nothing
But to me it means, means everything

She paints her eyes as black as night now
She pulls those shades down tight
Oh yeah there's a smile when the pain comes
The pain gonna make everything alright

Chorus

She talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name
Oh yeah, yeah angels
Call her out by her name
Oh, oh, oh angels
They call her out by her name

Oh, she talks to angels
They call her out,
Yeah, yeah call her out
Don't you know that they call her out
By her name
