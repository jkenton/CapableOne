Longform something:
[Smart Keyboard Folio](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXNK2LL/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-generation-and-ipad-air-5th-generation-us-english) 179.99

[Logitech Folio Touch Keyboard Case with Trackpad for iPad Air (5thÂ generation)](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPB92ZM/A/logitech-folio-touch-keyboard-case-with-trackpad-for-ipad-air-5th-generation) 159.99

[No name Keyboard Case](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-2020-Touchpad-Detachable-Leather-Generation/dp/B093GRDQBR/ref=sr_1_1) 50.00

[Brydge Air Max+ Keyboard with Trackpad](https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-air-max-plus?variant=39421148594281) 149.99
