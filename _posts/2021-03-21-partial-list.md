I was able to get BBEdit to format the page headers automagically. So, now I'm flying!

I had forgotten how powerful BBEdit was when I decided to dedicate my hardcore nerdery to Linux. And then I gave that up in deference to my workplace's so-called "security policies". I must say, my workplace has done a great job keeping the demondogs off our backs as users. So, no complaints. I just like having more control over my work machine.

Even if it makes my work machine a hazard to the security of the others, I guess.

Anyhow, BBEdit is a great tool. And it does an amazing array of new things since the last time O used it...
