I've seen a few different reports lately speaking about the Boy Scouts of America filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (<a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/02/18/the-boy-scouts-of-america-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-heres-what-that-means-for-you/">example</a>).

I never understood the various chapters of the bankruptcy code, but I can say that very rarely are healthy, thriving businesses mentioned in the same sentence as bankruptcy. And the number of businesses that recover from bankruptcy is also quite small compared to the number that don't.

I may be an apologist for the BSA. I was an active scout in Mitchell SD, Worthington, MN, and Avoca IA. I am an Eagle Scout ('89). I worked for two summers at the Lewis and Clark Scout Reservation in Tabor, South Dakota ('85 and '87). I most recently was the Chartering Organization Representative (COR) for the Troop that was hosted by the Church I attend.

Because of my experience as the COR, I know what kind and level of training that now goes into EVERY person who has an official role related to a Troop or Pack. The training was intensive and comprehensive. The training made clear that behaviors were being constantly monitored, and by everyone involved. The bottom line was that no non-custodial adult was ever allowed to be alone with any boy. Not even in the same room prior to a meeting. The abuse scandal necessitated that level of expectation.

I can say without a doubt that I was never abused during a Boy Scout function (or ever), and I can also say that I don't know anybody else who was. I do know that there are other boys who were. Those men and boys deserve their day in court. They deserve peace and healing as they cope with the trauma and abuse.

Yet, I know so many young men who were at least helped - if not downright saved - by the Scouts. Some of these young men had no opportunity otherwise to get outside of their hometown, or to learn about the Outdoors, or any number of other pursuits. For some of these young men, it was a chance to have an adult male role model. Scouting gave young men a chance to see themselves among other young men, to cooperate (and sometimes compete) with them, learning along the way about fair play, honesty, and the importance of being trustworthy and loyal and helpful and friendly and all the rest.

I know it sounds like a eulogy. Maybe it will be. I hope not. I'm old enough to understand the costs of litigation and settlements, and the indelible loss of reputation, and the "together-alone" nature of today's youth society are all taking their devastating toll. I guess I file this under the heading of "damned shame". While I acknowledge that many young men were victimized while participating in Scouting activities, I also feel that there are far, far, far more young men who were saved by Scouting and the Ideals it helped them adopt.
