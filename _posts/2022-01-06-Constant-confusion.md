I don't know.

There's a lot of really confusing things to figure out, and several of them are competing for "Brain RAM", lately. That competition is leading to frustration and confusion.

For example, last year at this time, the public was thankful for the presence of various educational technologies (such as Zoom or Meet, or Teams, or whatever) to allow children the chance to continue receiving some schooling. 

I don't think anybody was proposing to continue in a remote stance, forever. I especially don't think teachers preferred it, since most of the teachers I've talked to have related a similar story: once students know that they don't HAVE to have their camera enabled, almost all of them turn theirs off. Which leaves the teacher to "perform" to a sea of black rectangles. Imagine being told that you need to do your job (whatever it is) to an empty room, in the dark.

But, these heroes continued apace, because the public school teachers I know are 100% dedicated to their cause.

Now the same public is complaining that their kids are being robbed of an in-person education, which will stunt their social development.

Let's return to basics: Remote learning is a measure taken to prevent kids and teachers from contracting the COVID virus, and potentially (especially if one is unvaccinated) getting dangerously sick. Or, as we are now seeing, a measure to allow students to continue learning despite a school environment that is otherwise infected and thus closed for lack of staffing or students.

Decision: I think people never truly took this COVID situation seriously, and through their lack of attention to the rules and guidance given by the experts at the CDC, people are getting sick in a widespread way. I could throw a "Selber Schuld" on the pile, but I do actually care that people remain uninfected, or at the least physically well.

And for example two, I summarize a set of angry reaction to the fact that I-95 was closed in both North- and South-bound directions for more than a day in response to a very large snowstorm. Some areas along the 40 or so miles closed down got 9 inches of snow.

The reactions varied from "How can emergency personnel get to folks if they need it?" to "Why didn't the Government do more to respond?" to "Why wasn't FEMA or the National Guard out there?" to "Why is the largest volume interstate on this side of the Mississippi River being shut down?" The audio program I was listening to had on a TV news person who gave important details: People were asked to confine their driving to necessity only. The snow was falling at a four inches per hour rate. There were multiple tractor-trailers jack-knifed [^jkt], blocking traffic, and those response vehicles couldn't get to the scene because of the extant traffic and the 9 inches of snow.

As you may know, I grew up in South Dakota. I'm well aware of what a Blizzard can do or become. I've heard stories of folks being stuck in their disabled vehicles for 24-48 hours, and some of them lost fingers or toes to frostbite (if not worse). So, my lens on this is somewhat clear: If you drive in a snowstorm that was forecast, and your car breaks down.... Well, you  had a chance to avoid that fate. 

Decision: I'm not going to blame anyone for trying, because sometimes the forecasts have been "wildly inaccurate", but once the snow starts falling, I'd advocate for folks getting off the road wherever and waiting it out.


 <img src="/images/insurrection.jpg" alt="Photo of the riot that invaded the US Capitol on January 6, 2021">

And let's not forget the reason for the season: The Insurrection of January 6, 2021. On that day, (and depending on who you believe) a group of protesters invaded the Capitol building, chanting death to [insert individual name of several elected officials], and causing wonton destruction. The DC National Guard was not activated prior to the event, despite prior knowledge of the number of folks who were anticipated to participate in the precipitating "Stop the Steal" rally. Despite the threats made to elected officials by the rioters, and the proximity of the White House to the initial rally where the President spoke (and frankly to the Capitol where most of the violence occurred), the President was never moved to a protective location. It's all very odd and difficult to parse... especially since the President at the time gives no indication that he knew anything like that could happen. 

Decision: Despite what folks would like (any number of senior officials of the prior administration indicted or jailed), that's just not how things work in the American justice system. If a person has lots and lots of money, they can always pay the bond and walk free until the time when a trial occurs. And even then, a rich person can delay the proceedings to an extent that exhausts the district attorney's will to see the person fully prosecuted, and the district attorney may offer a plea deal instead. And a truly rich person can negotiate the terms of that plea deal... Before you try to act this way yourself, just be careful that the umbrella really covers YOU before trying to evade a shitstorm. No, instead, pay attention to who you think is behind such a thing and make sure that neither THEY nor any of their associates ever get back into power through the ballot box.

Some perspective here. I really loved reading Mike Royko columns. He was constantly needling folks in power, and sometimes got corrupt folks to step down. But he also offered that many old newspaper guys only thrilled to the chase. They wanted the corrupt politician to get caught, but were indifferent to whether they got punished. Like a catch-and-release situation. If I caught you once, you grimy low-life, I can catch you again!

Maybe take this approach: The Former President did a lot of things that were openly on the edge of criminal. But, don't get your hopes up that he or anyone in his family will actually get punished. Only underlings get that kind of punishment. Instead, mock his inability to escape pursuit by the authorities.
