Sometimes, I am hard to get through to. Hard headed, you might say. Stubborn. Maybe even something less kind...

In the last 24 hours, a number of very apt descriptors have come to my attention:

[from the Omniscient Observer on Facebook]

"When you're not used to being confident, confidence feels like arrogance.<br />
When you're used to being passive, assertivenss feels like aggression.<br />
When you're not used to getting your needs met, prioritizing yourself feels selfish.<br />
Your comfort zone is not a good benchmark."

AND

Today, walking my do. Lil Rel Howery talking to Neal Brennan on Brennan's podcast called "Blocks". Lil Rey and shared a comment from Jay-Z about the pressure Black people feel while doing creative works. He said, "you do feel like your community is on your back."

On your back has two meanings, at least how I understand it. First, "on your back" can mean that a person is over-critical. Or it can mean that a person is dependent (or over-dependent) on you.

Anxiety, for me, does feel like my loved ones are on my back. Now, I also understnad that people are on my back, in a dependency way, because I put them there. Truly, hardly anyone is TRULY on my back in a critical way. Yet, look at the graphic. Innocent comments really get through. Anger. Defiance. Overplanning. It's like the artist was describing my internal monologue... 

Except for the sleeping... I can fall asleep just about anywhere. And that sleeping anywhere WAS a point of contention growing up. I don't know why taking naps was such a hard thing for others to accept...

I've got something to chew on now. Let's GO!
