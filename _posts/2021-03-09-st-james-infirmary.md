[*Ed: New Orleans has a very different relationship to death, and how to celebrate life. Holy Moly, what a good song.*]


Lyrics:
*sotto voce*
It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said
<br />
<br />

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there<br />
She was stretched out on a long white table,<br />
So sweet, cool and so fair<br />
<br />
Let her go, let her go, God bless her<br />
Wherever she may be<br />
She may search this whole wide world over<br />
Never find a sweeter man as me<br />
<br />
When I die please bury me in straight lace shoes<br />
I want a box back coat and a Stetson hat<br />
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain<br />
The gang'll know I died standing pat<br />
