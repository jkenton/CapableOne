Im mid May 2023, I saw the above trailer. It didn't have the acknolwedgements at the end, revealing it to be an AI-generated conception. And I was enthralled! Enraptured! EXCITED. I even put a note in my task tracking system for mid-September (that's now) to check back in and see when it was due to be released.

Alas, the entire thing was - as mentioned before - an AI-generated conception only.

Now, why was I taken in? Maybe I secretly like Wes Anderson movies? Maybe I saw the casting decisions and thought they were hilarious? Maybe I just wanted to see Bill Murray sad-eye his way through Tolkein's Gandalf? Or Ben Stiller as a knight?

Anyway, it was very convincing. Bravo, [Curious Refuge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrjL_TSOFrI&ab_channel=CuriousRefuge), you got my hopes up! Bastards.
