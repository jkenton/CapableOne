I'm not going to fight anyone about this, but it seems like a reconstruction-era interchange between a northerner, and a southern peddler.

If you would like to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, here you go.

I also recommend you listen to the podcast <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/ump/48/">Unjustly Maligned #48 "R.E.M., Early"</a> featuring Merlin Mann.

You know the rules. This song was in my head while getting ready for work today.


*Swan, swan, hummingbird<br />
Hurrah, we are all free now<br />
What noisy cats are we<br />
Girl and dog he bore his cross<br />*

*Swan, swan, hummingbird<br />
Hurrah, we are all free now<br />
Long low time ago<br />
People talk to me<br />*

*Johnny Reb, what's the price of fans<br />
Forty a piece or three for one dollar?<br />
Hey captain, don't you want to buy<br />
Some bone chains and toothpicks?<br />*

*Night wings or hair chains<br />
Here's your wooden greenback, sing<br />
Wooden beams and dovetail sweep<br />
I struck that picture ninety times<br />*

*I walked that path a hundred ninety
<br />Long, low time ago, people talk to me<br />*

*A pistol hot cup of rye<br />
The whiskey is water, the water is wine<br />
Marching feet, Johnny Reb, what's the price of heroes?<br />*

*Six in one, half dozen the other<br />
Tell that to the captain's mother<br />
Hey captain, don't you want to buy?<br />
Some bone chains and toothpicks?<br />*

*Night wings, her hair chains<br />
Swan, swan, hummingbird<br />
Hurrah, we are all free now<br />
What noisy cats are we<br />*

*Long, low time ago, people talk to me<br />
A pistol hot cup of rye<br />
The whiskey is water, the water is wine<br />*
