Just freshly back from another adventure at the cottage. As Robert Frost has said, "way leads on to way", and this may become one of the few remaining times that I visit there. It was a great respite for the better part of twenty years, but those days are now likely over.

The picture above is what was once Sigrids on the Lake, advertised as a Supper Club in the grand tradition. Alas, way has led on to way for her as well, and Sigrid's the restaurant is now no longer a restaurant. In fact, the signpost at the vital corner where one must turn off the main road to get to Sigrid's, well that signpost is gone. The only remnant that indicates Sigrid's Restaurant is this rather "less than accommodating" sign in the parking lot:

Another Supper Club named the Cotton Patch was along the same stretch of road, and has also suffered the same fate. I can't find the picture I though I took. Alas...

For those in the audience of few who read this blog, AND  who don't know what is a supper club, <a href="http://www.oldfashionedthemovie.com/">here is a great website</a> that includes links to purchase both a copy of the documentary and a copy of the cookbook.

One step-stone of getting older is seeing virtually all of your favorite childhood things disappear. As my parents further explained, getting much older is an opportunity to see all your older family members, and many of your friends die as well. *Memento Mori*, folks. Live now!
