There is always a greater nerd. Always.

I thought I was a pretty big nerd for adapting a two-dice, tabletop baseball game into a three dice tabletop baseball game. You know, to more naturally account for the probabilities of infrequent things (like hitting a triple).

And then I listened to Keith Olbermann's "Countdown" podcast. A nerd in his own right, Keith started at Cornell in his mid-teens (if you can believe wikipedia: "he enrolled at Cornell University at the age of 16."). And not just a nerd, a baseball nerd. 

He mentioned - in passing - a dice baseball game called "Extra Innings." A dice game played with three colored dice. Red White Green, if I recall.

I thought my dice baseball was a nerd-out. Extra innings leverages the colored dice and will take into account whether a player is left- or right-handed, and whether a fly ball was hit deep or shallow, and can involve actual players (via their trading cards).

[Aside: I'm not here to shill for the game, but there is a trove of stuff associated with the game, and how to play and modify it [at this link](https://www.tabletop-sports.com/downloads.php?cat_id=16). Enjoy, fellow nerd!]

So, lest you feel like you are a giant nerd, you might be. But it is HIGHLY unlikely that your are the GREATEST NERD.  So enjoy your morning Soylent and get back to work!
