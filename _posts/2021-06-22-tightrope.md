Ordinarily, when I post a music video here, its because the song got in my head and wouldn't leave for a little bit.

This one is different.

It's a song about struggle and redemption. About putting in the hard work and reaping the benefits. Stevie's was coke and alcohol, and his benefits were pretty great. He put out two great albums after getting completely clean (*In Step* with his own band, and *Family Style* with his brother Jimmie), albums that still get lots of play around here.

It's hard to face problems head on. And this song is an anthem to those with the bravery to try. And once you make it through the hardest times, it's an anthem to remind one to reach back an help others as they go through their toughest times:

>Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin 
>Through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend 
>We've all had our problems that's the way life is 
>My heart goes out to others who are there to make amends

He died in a helicopter crash in August of 1990 at Alpine Valley in Wisconsin. I can still remember the frat bros at the bus stop discussing it the day after it happened. Anyhow, this one was on my mind today, and here I'm sharing it with you.
