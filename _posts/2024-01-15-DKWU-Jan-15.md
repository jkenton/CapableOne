Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of coffee, and shares some tidbits about the weekend ahead.

America is a weird place sometimes. Where a person can have a great idea, intending to help everyone, with no overt plan to harm anyone. Yet, the people who jealously guard their "hard-earned" success feel threatened by it. And the people who would most directly benefit from it shatter into two opposing camps: One that works toward the development, and another that fights against it, for one reason or the other. THIS is America. Where a complaint like "This sucks, change it" can seem like a legitimate counter-argument to both the status quo AND the innovation. Where the person who says "This sucks, change it" can be seen as someone who is worthy of our time and attention, rather than dismissed for their lack of participation.

For as long as a person of comfort and means feels threatened by a person who wants their fair chance at the same status, the means can be used to prevent that other person from that chance.

Frustrating.

Happy Martin Luther King Jr. day, everyone. Here are some suggested readings and listenings, as curated by Dr. King's youngest daughter, Bernice. Enjoy this day.
