1. Today is Wednesday, April 13 (Happy Aprilteenth!)
2. My agenda is filled with amorphous tasks. (My hovercraft is full of eels, as well). Lunch with friends, then GRADING like a MOFO
3. In my cup: Tim Horton's Original Blend with Coffeemate. Verdict: Delicious
4. Song for the Day is "Hey Ladies" by the Beastie Boys
