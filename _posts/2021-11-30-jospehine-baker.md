I don't know as much about Josephine Baker as I should.  So, have a look at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Baker)

Why today? Well, she is being symbolically interred in the Pantheon in Paris, for her immeasurable contributions to France during her life (esp. during World War II). She's the first black woman to be memorialized there. I say memorialized because her body will remain buried in Monaco, but some symbols of her life will be buried in a casket in the Pantheon itself (Vault 13). [Much more detail here](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/30/1059776777/josephine-baker-france-pantheon)

In a country like ours, why did so many celebrated black folks need to escape to have their talents adequately recognized? Infuriating.
