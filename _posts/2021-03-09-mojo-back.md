Yesterday made me question myself. So many things lined up one after the other to show how I can get things wrong.

A lot of this stuff bothers me, because it revolves around technology. Maybe in my mind, I won't let myself feel like I can drop a technology problem? Gotta Fix it!

And if i don't know how to fix it, that must be some sort of moral failing, right?

And eat some more jellybeans to soothe the anxiety about it all.

Yet, I made it work. I typed quick responses during meetings when the microphone didn't work in Zoom.

I made a pretty good dinner last night with a Butterball Turkey Roast.

I am not a miserable failure.

And then this morning, I recognized that the Zoom app on this computer is actually a module of Chrome. And in the past, I've had trouble with certain audio and video stuff because of an extension. Once I told the extension to ignore the site that the materials were hosted, the microphone started working again.

So, no I am not a failure. I just let myself get overwhelmed when a series of things started going off the rails. And I know that sometimes stuff will go off the rails. That's how I used to earn my "papers" when I was in grad school.
