This one act play showed on the TV New Years Eve 1989-1990 while I was an exchange student in Switzerland. My host-dad laughed so hard that i thought he was going to stop breathing...

It wasn't the first time that the show was on TV, and has been shown many times since (always on New Year's Eve). For some reason, it hits the sense of humor that appeals most to Germans and German-speaking folks.

The next time you find yourself in Germany, and a German person is explaining something in multiple steps, wait until the end and say "Same procedure as last year?" If they don't at least smile, you will know that they are not truly German. Maybe a Dane or something.
