"I could never be an astronaut"

I was just a throwaway line in my journal. But, it's also a culmination of some thought that I've had for a long time. My obsessive desire to be able to visualize things led me to look up the cubic space in the Apollo Service  and Command modules. To be in that kind of proximity for two weeks with two other fully adult humans... With no chance to get away... Yeah, I'm good here on Earth. 

There's an exchange in "The Martian" where the guy stranded on Mars taunts the astronauts aboard the rescue vessel. Saying that he can go outdoors whenever he wants...

I enjoy my autonomy and sovereignty a little too much to be an astronaut. Not that I need to range over miles and miles. I'm pretty content at home. But, cramped into a tin can with two other adult humans into a space the size of a jail cell? No thank you!

Anyway, that's what came to mind...
