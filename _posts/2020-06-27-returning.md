This pandemic has been quite a trip. It has messed with my mind. Secretly. Deceptively. Certainly.

It is only in looking back that one can see all the craziness in bold relief.

Eight months ago, a person joined us from Alaska. Four months ago, that person left us for the hereafter. Three and an half months ago, we moved into this house. Three months ago, we were all told to go home and await further instructions.

And now there is a three month blurry spot in my memory. I couldn't reliably tell you what I've done in that time. Moving, moving, moving. I've left a bread crumb trail. I could piece it all back together. But, why? There's a lot of triumph, joy, pain, frustration, excitement, disappointment, plans dashed at the last moment, new opportunities arose and fleeted away.

So, anyway, I've got this system set up in a way that makes some sense. And I'm going to try to not be so fancy in the future.

I'm weary. Maybe that's it. Weary of trying to maintain regularity for others, and deal with the craziness in secret. I'm realizing though that there is a good reason for the phrase "Stay in your lane". I'm not doing an entirely great job in my work right now. Tired.

I'll get back on the horse though.
