Rules are rules...

*Tastes good when you're hungry / Tastes good when you're thirsty*

I think I became acquainted with Saffire through a music podcast called Bandana Blues with Beardo and Spinner. Beardo was a chef in and around Philly. Spinner is a harmonica player from Holland. They used to split the show, with Beardo providing the banter and introducing the songs. And Spinner would submit a "section", featuring blues and R&B-inspired acts from Europe. Beardo's main motivation was to promote living people. So, hardly any classic blues, but a lot of contemporary bands like Joe Bonamossa and The Meters, you get the notion. Anyway, Beardo played Saffire af ew times, and both of these cuts got some attention.

Sadly, Beardo (Ted Dames) died in September of 2017 at the age of 65. Anyhow, here are a couple songs from Saffire, because they rattled my brain today.
