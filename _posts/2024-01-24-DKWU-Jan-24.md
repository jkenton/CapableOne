Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of coffee, and some tidbits about the day ahead. 

[Peet's Big Bang](https://www.peets.com/products/big-bang), pour one out for Peets...

[Oatmeal and a Banana](https://www.quakeroats.com/products/hot-cereals/old-fashioned-oats-quick-oats), but that isn't quite it either

[Hearty Traditional](https://www.quakeroats.com/products/hot-cereals/steel-cut-oats/traditional), ahhh... that's the stuff!

I slept 7 hours and 9 mins (Hooray!)
