Ordinarily, I know that it's a 50:50 proposition that anyone else will even read this. And that's OK.

And even if someone reads it, it's only a 50:50 chance that they'll learn something from a timely notice like this one. Today, I feel like someone took a 10 pound sledge to my upper body and filled my head with cement (and not in a good way).

I'd lay down to compensate for the lack of sleep I got last night, but that just makes the head throbbing more profound.

I hope you are feeling your best way today, and send some healing vibrations my way. You know, if you see this, and you think of it.
