There are two scenes in Silverado, both involving conversations with Paden and another important character. The first (chronologically) is when Cobb (the sheriff) fires the saloon manager very publically, and kicks the now-fired manager into the street. Paden is hired on the spot to replace him. The manager could have trotted off without harm, but decided to come back with a gun to kill Cobb. Stella warns the manager to not do it, which alerts Cobb. Cobb then shoots the manager down in the street in front of the saloon. As the crowd is breaking up and going back to their daily lives, Scott Glenn's character Emmett asks Paden "You used to ride with that guy?" And Paden stands there stone-faced. Perhaps thinking to himself "Bad luck?" No dude, you knew he was dirty, or deeply suspected it before now...

The second scene is later in the movie, and takes place after Hell has broken loose in town. Cobb is on a rampage for one reason or another (probably because his shady empire is closing in on him, and he has desperately few remaining friends). Lots of people are newly-hurt as well as the many folks who have been hurt previously. Stella and Paden are in the saloon:


<pre>
Stella : Cobb's using me to stop you. So good people are being hurt because of me. That makes me mad. Some people think because they're stronger, or meaner, that they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.

Paden : I like your attitude. But it can be risky.

Stella : I'm ready for that. What about you?

Paden : [heavy sigh]  I don't want you to get hurt.

Stella : He can't hurt me... if he's dead.
</pre>

And then soon thereafter, Cobb and Paden are in the street ready to draw down on one another. And Paden says more than this, but importantly, he says "Cobb, you've got nothing I need" before they both fire, and Cobb drops dead.
