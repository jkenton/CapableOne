Characters:
The station, where the train has already left, or has not yet arrived.

A group of people standing in rain coats, waiting.

After unloading their luggage, two kids looking expectantly at the candy machine, hoping that more caramels will come out in addition the ones they've already eaten.

The Station Agent is on the telephone, his hat is hanging on the wall.

A man is sitting in the warm waiting room, smoking a stinky cigar, reading the local newspaper.

The clock rings out, and a worker with dirty hands pulls a lever to align the rails so he can assemble a series of cargo cars.

The Station Agent puts on his hat, an express train rushes through, making a big gust of wind, and the Agent removes his hat.
