Sometimes being a "good kid" pays off waaaay down the line. I mean in a gratitude way.

A few years ago, I made a gratitude journal for my mom. I don't remember any single detail about it, but she wrote me a text and attached the above picture.

It was on the very first page of this gratitude journal. I have no idea if I wrote any other gratitudes in it, but that one is a pretty good one...

[The inscription says: "Mom, thanks for understanding that a curious kid sometimes needs to go to the emergency room on the day before school pictures."]
