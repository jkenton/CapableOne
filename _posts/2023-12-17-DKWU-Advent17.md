I discovered two Advent calendars at my local Aldi. One is the [Barissimo Coffee Advent Calendar](https://www.aldi.us/en/products/advent-holiday-calendars/list/detail/ps/p/barissimo-coffee-advent-calendar-2/), and the other is the Pure Being Dog Treat Advent calendar (Sorry, no link avaiable).

  

Each day between December 1 and December 24, I will share those Advent calendars and some events of the day. Then, I will try to guess the name of the coffee flavor. Does he guess today's flavor correctly? Watch and find out!

  

If you have no patience for my antics, avail yourself of the [Spoilers](https://thecapableone.com/spoilers.html) page. If you do have patience, well, no additional input required.

[ed: I am not putting down the Barissimo coffee company when I say that the Amaretto coffee in yesterday's video smelled much better than it tasted. It smelled very much like Amaretto. It tasted not at all like Amaretto. But, I DID finish it. I am not made of money, or full of pride!]
