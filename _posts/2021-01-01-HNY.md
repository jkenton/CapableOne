The Year 2020 is not one that will soon be forgotten. A pandemic will do that. And for me, 2020 will always represent a particular kind of topsy-turvy. A particular kind of chaos that hasn't yet resolved.

Here are some notable events from 2020 from the Kenton family in Elkton, MD:

* Jeff's Aunt Mary died in January
* Nicki's dad died in February
* Jeff and Nicki bought a house in Elkton and moved into it in March
* Pandemic sends everyone home March to the present day
* A number of very hopeful events led the University to announce plans to re-open in August
* Within a couple of days, the rate of infection went above the established threshold, and University closes to face to face instruction
* As of January 1, no person working at Towson was infected in the workplace, which is an amazing accomplishment
* Fall semester is a long slog anyway, but Fall 2020 was substantially worse than normal
* Jeff's Uncle Dick died in September
* The United States of America had one of the highest turnouts in history for its General Election, which includes offices like the President. As of today, the incumbent is still disputing the results. The Congress will certify the other guy as the winner on January 6
* Jeff's dad turned 80 in November
* Jeff's mom turned 80 in December
* Jeff's Uncle George died in December

Projections for the availability of the COVID vaccine indicate that Nicki will get her second dose in a couple weeks. Jeff's projection (along with the kids) will be in mid-May to early June. Jeff sent some emails asking for guidance on how Towson wants this to go. Do i get vaccinated whenever I am able and bring back official documentation, or do I wait for Towson to offer availability, as they did with the COVID test I took in August?

So, anyway, please know that these milestones of time are becoming almost meaningless. One day is seeming more and more just like any other day...

HAPPY NEW YEAR, y'all!! And now some wholesome entertainment from Seattle's own James Marshall Hendrix. There's even a Happy New Year message in there! (from 3:58 - 7:45 is a sonic representation of how things went since March 10 or so.)
