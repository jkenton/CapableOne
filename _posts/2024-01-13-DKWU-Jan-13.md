Dr. Kenton wakes up with a cup of coffee, and shares some tidbits about the weekend ahead.

[Ed: it gets a little spicy after 11 minutes or so... PG-13 today.]

Feelings are real.

Cold weather is coming by Tuesday (four days from now). I use about a bag of pellets a day in the pellet stove. I have six days worth of pellets AND 70+ gallons of heating oil in the boiler for the radiators as backup. I've got all kinds of other ways to warm the house (like oven and electrical radiators)... So, why am I so nervous about not having enough pellets or oil?  This seems like a pattern of beating myself up for ALMOST failing... let's aim for NORMAL PARAMETERS.

Monday is a holiday, but I'll be back then. We aren't making fast enough progress on the goal of learning to just accept everyone. Cannot we just accept people as full examples of humanity?

Salad Bowl metaphor  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_bowl_(cultural_idea)
(I mentioned the Bread Pudding metaphor. That idea is something they spoke about when I was in grad school 25+ years ago.)

My dumb example of the melting pot metaphor was this:
5 gallons of vanilla pudding + 2 gallons of chocolate pudding + 1 gallon of pistachio pudding + 1 gallon whipped cream + a lot of chopped nuts = something like 8 gallons of plain vanilla pudding. (excuse the math... I'm just waking up...)
