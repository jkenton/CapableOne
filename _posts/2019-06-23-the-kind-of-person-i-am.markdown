Yesterday, I was on the National Mall in Washington DC. I was transiting from the Washington Monument area to the Lincoln Monument area and noticed that the Lockkeeper's House was open.

There wasn't much to see in the house, but there WERE rubber stamps... So I stamped my notebook with one. Then, because I am a *Nerd*, I decided to find out if they were all the same. They weren't. See image above...

There was one each for:

* The Lockkeeper's house
* National Mall
* Constitution Gardens
* Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence
* National Mall and Memorial Parks


Then I noticed that the date information was not correct on *some* of them (*Nerd Level 2*)

So I **fixed** them... (*Nerd Level 3*)

Yes, indeed... and now that I am looking at the stamps I made, I left one on "Jul 22, 2020" instead of "Jun 22, 2019" (*sad trombone*)

Ladies?
