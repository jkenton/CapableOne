Mondays are already a mess, without any help. When I visited my doctor, she said "Set up an image study." I said OK. Then I started getting a flurry of text messages from this scheduler, asking WHERE WHEN WHY. Then a tamer set, saying "Hey Man, no worries, here's a URL that you can use to get yourself registered, and then we'll call you to set up the appointment." That's my speed.

So I did.

Within a half hour or so, I get a phone call. Where? I told them I live in Elkton. I hear a short series of Hmmm noises, presumably while the scheduler looks for an imaging place near me...

So I throw a life line. "I also work in Towson, so anywhere near Towson would work too." Kapow! "We have a lot of places around Towson, do you want Lutherville, Timonium..." I said, "Lutherville is fine. When do you have an appt that is soon?"  How about the 28th?

OK, then the preparations: No food for 6 hours prior to the study/ No worries. I'll eat after.

Then the confirmations come, and the confirmations say no food, no water (except a sip, maybe to take necessary meds).

I like drinking water, so right now is kinda tough. The no food isn't as big a deal, somehow. Today is hot. I don't want to dehydrate. So, I've been inside doing indoor work to save my "moisture."

If I knew no food, no water, I probably would have scheduled for early morning...

Anyhow, it will work out! Have faith, Grasshopper!
