[Ed: if you asked me, I wouldn't claim to be a big fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Yet, there are these calling out to me...]

Lyrics

You better watch what you say  
You better watch what you do to me  
Don't get carried away  
Girl, if you can do better than me, go  
Yeah, go but remember

Good love is hard to find  
Good love is hard to find  
You got lucky, babe  
You got lucky, babe, when I found you

You put a hand on my cheek  
And then you turned your eyes away  
If you don't feel complete  
If I don't take you all of the way then go  
Yeah, go but remember

Good love is hard to find  
Good love is hard to find  
You got lucky, babe  
You got lucky, babe, when I found you

Yeah, go just go, but remember

Good love is hard to find  
Good love is hard to find  
You got lucky, babe  
You got lucky, babe, when I found you
