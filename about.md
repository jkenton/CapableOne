This is *literally* the hardest page to write on the blog. Because, *why* does any blog exist? This one is mostly ramblings from some kid who grew up in South Dakota, and has been making his way all over the place. Mostly that. And silliness. And long pauses.

Mostly,the site acknowledges that when things get tough, people rely on the Capable One to get things done. And mostly, that goes to plan and everything is good.

Sometimes, the Capable One is the one that needs help. And in many cases that help isn't forthcoming. Because, you know, Capable One.

I've been told that my tone is hard to decode. Sorry. Mostly I am a happy guy. Infrequently, I want to burn down the world out of frustration. Stories about both of those extremes - and a lot of mundane crap too, and MUSIC I like - are included here.

WELCOME!

June 2021 Update: Maybe some video content too, coming soon. Maybe.
