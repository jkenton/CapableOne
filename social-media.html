First off, this policy is not here to make myself out to be something I am not. And it differs markedly from my <a href="http://professorkenton.com/2021/02/17/social-policy.html">Professional Social Media Policy</a>

Rather, it is to explain what I am and why. Let's begin!
<P />

I use a few different types of social media, but I actively use Facebook and Twitter. This policy covers how I address friend requests or connections on those platforms.
<P />

Facebook is personal stuff. You probably will only become a Facebook friend if I have met you in real life, or you are also member of a Facebook group with me.  Frankly, my life is really boring. There is no big benefit to being a Facebook friend. Unless you like pictures of food, vacations, or my kids and extended family. No, really. Even I am starting to nod off just thinking about it.
<P />

Twitter is more snarky and unfiltered. My username for personal stuff is @jkenton. There is nothing I can do to stop you following me. I generally will follow back, because there is no reason not to. I respond to some of the issues I care about, and shoot the breeze there with other people that have the misfortune of having me as a follower. I keep my DM open. I figure I am smart enough to deal with that, and to quote Jim Croce in "Next Time This Time": <i>I can hang up as fast as you can call</i> My professional Twitter gets a lot more random folks DM'ing me than my personal one, even though my personal one generates a LOT more tweets. Who knows why?
<P />

Email is not social media. I am pretty good at dealing with email. As of the year 2021, I have more than 25 years of experience with email as a  communication device. I have a quick delete finger.
<P />

To summarize:
<P />
1. You probably won't become a Facebook friend unless we've met or we have another common group relationship.
<br/>2. I will follow back on Twitter.
<br/>3. I deal swiftly and surely with nonsense in my private email.
